## About The Project

The **Alpaca Option Trading Frontend** is a user-friendly web interface designed to facilitate options trading through Alpaca’s Trading API. It enables users to explore, manage, and execute options trades including single-leg and multi-leg strategies such as calls, puts, straddles, spreads, and more. This frontend aims to simplify the complexities of options trading by providing real-time data visualization, contract filtering, and seamless order management.

Built to work with Alpaca’s paper trading and live environments, this project is ideal for developers and traders who want to algorithmically or manually trade options with a modern, intuitive interface.
