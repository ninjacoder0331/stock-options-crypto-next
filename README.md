## About The Project

The **Alpaca Option Trading Frontend** is a sophisticated, user-centric web interface that streamlines the exploration, management, and execution of options trading through Alpaca’s Trading API. Supporting both single-leg and advanced multi-leg strategies—including calls, puts, straddles, spreads, iron butterflies, and iron condors—it delivers real-time data visualization, comprehensive contract filtering, and efficient order management. Engineered for Alpaca’s paper and live trading environments, it empowers developers and traders with a robust platform for both algorithmic and manual options trading.

## API Integration

The frontend integrates Alpaca’s REST and streaming APIs to:

- Authenticate and manage user accounts securely.
- Query real-time stock and options market data.
- Submit and manage orders via `MarketOrderRequest`, `LimitOrderRequest`, and multi-leg order requests.
- Subscribe to WebSocket streams for live trade and order updates.

Example: Submitting a market order using Node.js backend

```
const { TradingClient, MarketOrderRequest, OrderSide, TimeInForce } = require('@alpaca/trading');

const tradingClient = new TradingClient('your_api_key', 'your_secret_key', { paper: true });

const orderRequest = new MarketOrderRequest({
  symbol: 'AAPL',
  qty: 1,
  side: OrderSide.BUY,
  time_in_force: TimeInForce.DAY,
});

const order = await tradingClient.submitOrder(orderRequest);
console.log('Order submitted:', order);
```
